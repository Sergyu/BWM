# BWM
The aim was to have the Business Analysis guys having their own IDE (as developers have MS VisualStudio, IntelliJ, Eclipse), 
to put some sort of ordered spell on their work and to help them during their journeys. 
What the POC does and what was the plan (at the tail end of this article you'll find a youtube presentation of the workable prototype):

1.Drawing capabilities - capacity to draw a logical flow with a predefined list of blocks
2.Simulation capabilities - running through the drawn schema business objects to help you run a simulation
3.Debug your simulation - let you pause (add breakpoints) and analyze the objects that flies through the wire
4.Add any documentation you might have (excel/pdf/word documents) to the relevant nodes or to the Model itself.
5.Capacity to work on a SuperModel that encompasses multiple model (having a distributed team of BAs working together)



Show-case example

The following video will show you a Document signing model. 
The document has 3 parts, each of the document part should be signed by a different signer (
each signer having it's own availability). During simulation you can see the objects that flies through the model 
and also the way the model can be debugged.
